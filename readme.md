# Pothole Detector ðŸ‘· (Under Development)
The Pothole Detector is an application designed to identify road potholes by assigning a unique identifier to each pothole, annotating them with coordinates based on their IP address, recording the timestamp of detection, and capturing photographs of each detected pothole. This program is implemented using Python, OpenCV, and YOLOv8.
## History ðŸ“šâœ¨
While driving on the highway, I observed road repair workers inspecting potholes. I noticed that their working method seemed less efficient as, for each pothole they encountered, they had to stop their vehicle, capture photographs, and document various details. Perhaps with the existence of this application, it could streamline their work.
